### Installation/Prerequisites
- Make sure you can run SQL and import all the CSV data in this directory. The code used was developed on pgAdmin4 and PostgreSQL 15.3 is the Relational Database Management System used for implementation and testing.
  - Both Postgres and pgAdmin4 can be downloaded from the [same EDB download link here](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads) and no stacks or plug-ins were used during the creation of the attached SQL scripts.
